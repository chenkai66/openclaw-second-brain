## Actions Performed
- Read sync-state.json to determine last processed timestamp
- Read data/raw-conversations.json to identify new conversations
- Verified no conversations exist with timestamp > 1770880200000
- Confirmed Second Brain server was not running and started it automatically
- Verified server is now accessible on http://0.0.0.0:8000
- Verified frontend accessibility and proper HTML rendering
- Checked knowledge database integrity and structure (4 entries, all properly formatted)
- Validated knowledge graph format and D3.js compatibility (29 nodes, 24 edges)
- Confirmed all existing content files are properly formatted with English-only content
- Tested API endpoints functionality through frontend verification
- Updated sync-state.json with current execution timestamp (1770885780000)
- Created comprehensive execution log documentation

## System Health Check
- Server status: Started and running (accessible on http://0.0.0.0:8000)
- Frontend accessibility: Accessible (HTML content loads correctly)
- File validation: All JSON and Markdown files are valid and properly formatted

## Issues Encountered
- **Server Not Running**: Second Brain server was not running at start of execution. Automatically started the server.
- **No New Content**: No new user conversations were available for processing in the raw data source beyond the last processed timestamp
- **Conversation Capture Monitoring**: Continue to monitor if conversation capture mechanism is working properly for future interactions

## Next Steps
- Continue regular sync cycles to process any newly captured conversations
- Monitor server uptime to ensure it remains running between executions
- If conversation capture issues persist, investigate and implement fixes to the capture mechanism
- Maintain current system health and performance standards
