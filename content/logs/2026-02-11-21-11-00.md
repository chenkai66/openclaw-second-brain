## Conversation Record

**User**: [cron:854afde9-d271-4e97-8489-5784ad84bde4 second-brain-intelligent-sync] 【Second Brain Intelligent Sync Task - English Mode】

Follow the instructions in /home/admin/clawd/second-brain/agent_todo.md precisely. Key requirements:

1. **Data Source Analysis**: Read new conversations from data/raw-conversations.json (timestamp > sync-state.json lastProcessedTimestamp)

2. **Intelligent Processing**:
   - Extract topic tags (server-deployment, cron-jobs, second-brain, knowledge-management, etc.)
   - Identify core content and key information points
   - **ALL GENERATED CONTENT MUST BE IN ENGLISH**

3. **Knowledge Base Update**:
   - Update data/knowledge-db.json with English summaries
   - Synchronize content/notes/ and content/logs/ .md files (frontend depends on these)
   - Update sync-state.json with new timestamp
   - Generate data/knowledge-graph.json

4. **System Maintenance**:
   - Validate all file formats are correct
   - Ensure Second Brain server is running and frontend accessible
   - Check agent-logs/ directory and review latest 3-5 log files for context
   - Create new log entry in agent-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-task-summary.md after completion

5. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Verify frontend displays proper English content without truncation
   - Confirm knowledge graph renders correctly
   - Test API endpoints are functional

After successful completion with new content processed, send notification to main session via message tool.
