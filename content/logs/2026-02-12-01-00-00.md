   - Extract topic tags (server-deployment, cron-jobs, second-brain, knowledge-management, etc.)
   - Identify core content and key information points
   - **ALL GENERATED CONTENT MUST BE IN ENGLISH**

3. **Knowledge Base Update**:
   - Update data/knowledge-db.json with English summaries
   - Synchronize content/notes/ and content/logs/ .md files (frontend depends on these)

   - Generate data/knowledge-graph.json

4. **System Maintenance**:
   - Validate all file formats are correct
   - Ensure Second Brain server is running and frontend accessible

5. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Verify frontend displays proper English content without truncation
   - Confirm knowledge graph renders correctly
   - Test API endpoints are functional
