# Second Brain

A knowledge management system that automatically logs conversations and extracts important topics into structured notes.

## Features

- Automatic daily conversation logging
- AI-powered topic extraction and note creation
- Markdown-based content storage
- Full CRUD operations via web interface
- Real-time sync capabilities
- Clean, responsive UI with dark/light mode support

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## API Structure

- `/api/sync` - Detects new conversations and updates content
- `/api/notes` - Creates new notes
- `/api/notes/[slug]` - Gets, updates, or deletes a specific note
- `/api/logs` - Creates new logs (typically triggered by sync)
- `/api/logs/[date]` - Gets, updates, or deletes a specific log

## Content Format

All content is stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `content/` directory:

- Logs: `content/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Notes: `content/notes/kebab-case-slug.md`

## Architecture

The system follows these core principles:

1. **Content-driven**: All data exists as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
2. **Near real-time**: Background task scans for new content every 60 seconds
3. **AI-organized**: File naming, titles, tags, and summaries are generated by AI
4. **Full frontend editing**: Complete CRUD operations available in the UI
5. **Secure writes**: All file operations go through controlled API routes

## Extending the System

To extend functionality:

1. Modify the `lib/memory-source.ts` to connect to your actual conversation source
2. Adjust the AI prompt templates in `lib/ai-organizer.ts` for different content styles
3. Add new UI components in the `app/` directory following the existing patterns
