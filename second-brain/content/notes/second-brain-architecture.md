# Second Brain Architecture

A comprehensive system for capturing, organizing, and retrieving knowledge through automated logging and AI-powered organization.

## Core Components
- **Real-time Sync**: Periodic detection of new conversation content
- **Content Manager**: Secure file system operations for Markdown content
- **AI Organizer**: Intelligent extraction and structuring of knowledge
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive UI for browsing and editing

## Implementation Details
The system automatically processes conversations every minute, extracting key topics and generating structured notes with semantic naming and proper categorization. All content is stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing metadata like tags, summaries, and relationships.
