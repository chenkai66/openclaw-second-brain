# Second Brain System Development and Knowledge Management

The Second Brain system represents a comprehensive approach to personal knowledge management through automated conversation capture, intelligent processing, and structured organization. Key components include:

## Core Features
- **Automated Logging**: Real-time capture of all conversations with proper metadata
- **Intelligent Synthesis**: AI-powered analysis to extract key insights and topics
- **Tag Management**: Consistent categorization system to prevent fragmentation
- **Knowledge Graph**: Visual representation of relationships between concepts
- **Web Interface**: Accessible frontend for browsing and searching knowledge

## Technical Implementation
- **Server Deployment**: Robust backend infrastructure with public network access
- **Cron Automation**: Scheduled tasks for periodic synchronization and maintenance
- **Data Persistence**: Reliable storage with version control and backup systems
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for seamless data exchange

## Current Status
The system is actively processing conversations and maintaining an organized knowledge base that grows more valuable over time. All content is now standardized in English for consistency and global accessibility.
