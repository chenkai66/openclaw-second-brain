**Timestamp**: 2026-02-11 09:31:00
**Execution Type**: Automatic (cron)

## Summary
- Conversations processed: 0
- New knowledge entries created: 0  
- Updated knowledge entries: 0
- Files generated: None (no new content to process)

## Data Sources
- Raw conversations file: /home/admin/clawd/second-brain/data/raw-conversations.json (3847 bytes)
- Last processed timestamp: 1770747360000 (2026-02-11T01:36:00+08:00)
- New conversations found: 0

## Actions Performed
- Read sync-state.json to determine last processed timestamp
- Read data/raw-conversations.json to identify new conversations
- Verified no conversations exist with timestamp > 1770747360000
- Started Second Brain server (was not running)
- Verified frontend accessibility and proper HTML rendering
- Checked knowledge database integrity and structure
- Validated knowledge graph format and D3.js compatibility
- Confirmed all existing content files are properly formatted
- Tested API endpoints functionality through frontend verification

## System Health Check
- Server status: Running (started successfully during this execution)
- Frontend accessibility: Accessible (HTML content loads correctly)
- File validation: All JSON and Markdown files are valid and properly formatted
- API endpoints: Frontend loads correctly, indicating API functionality
- Knowledge graph: Properly formatted with 29 nodes and 24 edges

## Issues Encountered
- **Server Not Running**: The Second Brain server was not running at the start of this execution and had to be started manually
- **No New Content**: Despite current active conversation (this cron job), no new user conversations were available for processing in the raw data source
- **Conversation Capture Monitoring**: Continue to monitor if conversation capture mechanism is working properly for future interactions

## Next Steps
- Continue regular sync cycles to process any newly captured conversations
- Monitor server uptime to ensure it remains running between executions
- If conversation capture issues persist, investigate and implement fixes to the capture mechanism
- Consider implementing automatic server restart if it goes down unexpectedly
