- Verified frontend accessibility and proper HTML rendering
- Checked knowledge database integrity and structure (4 entries, all properly formatted)
- Validated knowledge graph format and D3.js compatibility (29 nodes, 24 edges)
- Confirmed all existing content files are properly formatted with English-only content
- Tested API endpoints functionality through frontend verification
- Verified tag library exists and is properly structured
- Updated sync-state.json with current execution timestamp

## Issues Encountered

- **Conversation Capture Monitoring**: Continue to monitor if conversation capture mechanism is working properly for future interactions

## Next Steps
- Continue regular sync cycles to process any newly captured conversations
- Monitor server uptime to ensure it remains running between executions
- If conversation capture issues persist, investigate and implement fixes to the capture mechanism
- Maintain current system health and performance standards
