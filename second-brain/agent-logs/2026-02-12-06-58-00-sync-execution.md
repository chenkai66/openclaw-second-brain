## Actions Performed
- Read sync-state.json to determine last processed timestamp (1770938520000)
- Read data/raw-conversations.json to identify new conversations
- Verified that current conversation timestamp matches last processed timestamp exactly
- Confirmed no new conversations require processing beyond previous execution
- Checked server status and confirmed it is running and accessible on http://0.0.0.0:8000
- Verified frontend accessibility by fetching HTML content successfully
- Tested API endpoints functionality:
  - Knowledge graph endpoint (/api/knowledge-graph) returns valid JSON with 5 nodes and 4 links
  - Tags endpoint (/api/tags) returns properly formatted tag data
  - Frontend loads complete HTML structure with all required dependencies
- Validated file integrity of existing knowledge database and log files
- Confirmed all content is in English-only format with no Chinese mixed content
- Verified proper markdown formatting in all generated files

## System Health Check
- Server status: Running and accessible on http://0.0.0.0:8000
