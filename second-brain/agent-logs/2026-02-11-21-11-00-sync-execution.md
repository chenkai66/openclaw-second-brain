- Created new knowledge entry: "Second Brain Intelligent Sync System and Maintenance"
- Generated frontend note file: content/notes/2026-02-11-second-brain-intelligent-sync-system.md
- Generated conversation log file: content/logs/2026-02-11-21-11-00.md
- Updated knowledge database with new entry
- Regenerated knowledge graph with updated nodes and edges
- Updated sync-state.json with new lastProcessedTimestamp (1770891060000)
- Verified all generated files are properly formatted with English-only content

## System Health Check
- Server status: Running and accessible on http://0.0.0.0:8000
- Frontend accessibility: Accessible (HTML content loads correctly)
- File validation: All JSON and Markdown files are valid and properly formatted
- API endpoints: All endpoints functional (knowledge-graph, tags, logs, notes)
- Knowledge graph: Properly formatted with 30 nodes and 25 edges, D3.js compatible
- Content language: All content verified to be in English only (no Chinese mixed content)

## Issues Encountered
- **Conversation Capture Issue**: The current cron job conversation was not automatically captured in raw-conversations.json. Manually added it to ensure proper processing.
- **Server Restart**: Server was not running at start of execution. Automatically started the server.

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring conversation capture mechanism to ensure automatic recording works properly
- Maintain regular sync cycles to process any newly captured conversations
- Monitor server uptime to ensure it remains running between executions
- If conversation capture issues persist, investigate and implement fixes to the capture mechanism
